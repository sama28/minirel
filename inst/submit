Here are the instructions for your MINIREL project submission:

1) Create a final executable called "minirel" - it should run on
   Linux.
 
2) Create a file called "listing"  - this file should contain
   the entire project listing including documentation, header files, etc.
   Ensure that the listing file is in structured order - that is, start
   with the project documentation, then for each layer, have its layer
   documentation and then club its routines together, ...

3) Create a single-page file called "summary"  which describes what this
   project is about and ALL the optimizations that you have made.  Also
   list the features you have NOT implemented (for example, indexing).

4) In your executable, ensure that you have dummy stub routines for the
   routines that you have NOT implemented.

5) Ensure that there are NO interactive parts in your code.  Further,
   all error messages should go to stdout, not stderr.  Also,
   the names of relcat and attrcat should be lower case.


Then, on November 17, mail to the course account your 
         ***********                 
"minirel", "listing" and "summary" files (as attachments).


The project demos will be held on November ?? afternoon from 2.00 pm onwards.
                                  ***********
In the demo, your MINIREL executable will be tested against a variety
of queries.  The demos will be scheduled in one-hour slots and I will
place a signup sheet on our lab board.  Put your (and partner's) name
in for the desired slot.
